AutoPong
========

Ever thought to yourself, "Man, I'd love to watch a game of Pong, but I hate having to play"? Then AutoPong is for you!

AutoPong is a Ruby-Processing script that plays a game of Pong by itself. It's more like a screensaver than anything else, but it was fun making it.

AutoPong is released under the MIT license, so have fun doing whatever you want with it.
